# Computer Architecture 1 - Course Repository

This repository contains materials, projects, and assembly programs related to the **"Computer Architecture 1"** course. The course provides fundamental knowledge about processor and computer system architecture, covering both simple RISC processors and commercial ARM architectures. It explains how instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed, and includes programming tasks in assembly language, as well as interactions between processors, memory, and external devices.

## Course Overview

The course gives an introduction to the architecture of processors and computer systems. The main topics covered include:
- Architecture of a simple RISC processor.
- Commercial ARM processor architecture.
- Instruction fetch, decode, and execution cycles.
- Basic algorithms programmed in assembly language.
- Processor interaction with memory and I/O devices.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the course and by completing the exercises in this repository, I have learned to:
- Identify and explain the basic components of a processor and computer system.
- Describe how instructions are executed in a processor.
- Understand the operation of key components of the processor.
- Solve basic programming tasks in assembly language.
- Explain how processors are connected to memory and I/O units.
- Solve tasks related to communication between the processor and input/output devices.

## Course Structure

### Lectures:
Weekly lectures (4 hours) cover the theoretical foundations of computer architecture, as well as practical examples using assembly language.

### Independent Tasks:
I have worked on simpler programming problems by writing assembly programs that solve specific tasks.

### Laboratory:
In the lab sessions, I wrote, tested, and executed assembly programs using a computer architecture simulator, gaining hands-on experience with processor instruction cycles and memory interactions.
